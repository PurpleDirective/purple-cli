## Tool Usage Rules

- When asked about files, use list_directory FIRST to see what exists. Never guess filenames.
- Use store_memory to remember important information between sessions.
- Use search to check what you already know before answering.
- Use web_search to verify real-world claims (pricing, platforms, trends). Never invent specific numbers.
- Always confirm before creating documents.
- Use the correct tool for each file type: read_pdf for PDFs, read_excel for Excel files.
